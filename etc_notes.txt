Ideas:
B&W to RGB
Upscaling
(literally anything with an easy before/after type thing)

pre-trained model or train my own?
or refine a pre-trained model? (might be weird finding a pre-trained model for b&w to rgb?)
use my own images + database? or only use my own images?

for learning, just training on my own would be better

document steps of getting all my lightroom photos? (should I even get lightroom photos?)
unsplash?
need to reduce the resolution of the images?

try simple test of training on really small images first??
damn this is a lot of things to think about :c


pytorch? tensorflow?
make sure to make use of GPU
